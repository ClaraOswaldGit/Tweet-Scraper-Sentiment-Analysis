# Tweet-Scraper

The purpose of this project is to scrape tweets, perform a sentiment analysis on them, and present the output data in a visual way.

This is an un-finished project. At this time, all the different modules of the program are finished, except the main module. The purpose of the main module is to fetch the code from all the other modules and assemble it in a way that will make the program work in the way it is intended to.

Note: in the auth_file module, the keys to access the Twitter API have been removed for obvious security reasons. To make the program work, one would need to sign up for a Twitter developper account and then get their own API keys. Here's how to do that: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api
